# Coding-Practice

Welcome to my Coding Practice repository! This is a collection of various coding projects and exercises that I have worked on to improve my skills in web development and other programming languages. Here, you'll find everything from simple HTML/CSS projects to more complex tasks that showcase my growth as a developer.

Projects Included:
Periodic Table: A simple periodic table created using HTML and CSS, styled with a pastel gradient background.
Other coding exercises and challenges that I've worked on, focusing on different aspects of web development and programming languages.
Technologies Used:
HTML5: For structuring web content and elements.
CSS3: For styling and layout, including advanced techniques like Flexbox, grid, and animations.
JavaScript (and other languages): For adding interactivity and enhancing the functionality of the projects.
Other technologies: As I continue to practice, you will see new technologies and tools being used.
